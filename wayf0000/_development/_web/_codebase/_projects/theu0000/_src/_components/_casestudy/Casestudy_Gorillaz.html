      2-D, Russel, Noodle and Murdoc dropped off the map. Where did they go? What were they up to?! Who can say.
      <br>
      All we know a most peculiar house popped up, and rumours are afoot. Could be it be? Could Gorillaz be back, after what feels like a g-damn eternity?
    </p>
    <p>
      The crew at B-Reel heard whispers on the wind, and after weeks seances the tealeaves could no longer be ignored. Gorillaz were on their way back!
    </p>
    <p>
      We approached the band and humbly asked if they would lend our skills to deliver something truly special to accompany their latest musical masterpiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      The end result was a mindblowing mobile app that explored their new housings in AR, VR and whateverelseR you liked. Up to, and including a full livestream of the entire album upon release. For free. Truly bonkers innit?
