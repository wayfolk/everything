  <p>ðŸ‘‹<br><b>Hello creative person</b><br><br> You're part of it. Part of the ones with a finger on culture's pulse. Part of those that toil. Those that make. Those that believe in creative excellence.<br><br>You know,<br>Part of Us.</p>
  <p>Before we begin, let us ask,<br>do you also feel it?<br><b>The pulling?</b><br>It's like a hole in reality.<br><br>The reality we've grown up in, the reality we were trained for, the one we were molded by.<br>A reality that was <i>real</i>, that was tangible, sometimes cruel, but somehow right.</p>
  <p>A reality that has been erased. Or, more accurately, simply ignored.<br>We live in a world where indendent work is marginalised. Creative has been replaced by "user experience". By a desparate desire to have something solid to cling to. Some research. Facts. Some double diamond driven approach that distills truths, unearths desires. That reveals the universe's mysteries and tells us what to do.<br><br>You know, pandering bullshit.</p>
  <p>How come pandering? Well, let's look at the creative landscape. It's been decimated. Sold out. The stragling survivors are trying to pivot into UX monstrosities just to have a product that they can possible sell.</p>
  <p>If you ask us,<br>IDEO's marketing trick worked well. A little too well.<br><br>They sold the idea that service design was the way. And sold the client on their seat at the table. Bundled up in a package that gives the illusion of control. Of input, of co-design (?).<br>And the world followed. A new reality was created.<br><br>And as a follow up to heir masterpiece of a magic trick, they now have the gall to sell you an exciting module on "how creativity can transform your business".<br>After decimating its role in chase of the almighty dollar.<br>It's impressive. In execution. And dishonesty.</p>
  and the whole time we looked at it. And failed to act.
  <p>We all think we're right. Fall asleep thinking others don't get it. Fighting for craft. Holding the banner of creativity over all. And yet, be it agency-bound or client-side, independent or collectivised, we've successfully pillarized* ourselves onto islands.</p>
  <p>It's the creative folk. The one's with a finger on culture's pulse. Those that toil. Those that make.</p>

thr turth that stays close to the core of the thing. Closer than any ux research can get you. to the core of the company
to why people buy your stuff. what they feel.

truth doesn't lie in research. it lies in what people feel.
and thats what creativity does. its role. its purpose.

and its crazy its getting lost in the shuffle.
