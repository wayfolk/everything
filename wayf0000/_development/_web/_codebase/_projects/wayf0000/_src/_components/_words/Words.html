    Hello creative peeps
  </h1>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    We‚Äôve started this little manifesto a few times. And, as of yet, haven‚Äôt quite managed to finish it.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Excuses aplenty. For example, we <span class="emphasis">could</span> talk about how the business of creativity is a cynical one (it is), where a fair few of our heroes fell prey to the ‚Äòol god of giving up (they did).
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Or we could <span class="emphasis">moan</span> about why it is that we have to bend the knee to every <span class="emphasis">silicon-valley-driven get-rich-quick-scheme</span> (we do), that‚Äôs eroding our soul (they are).
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    We <span class="emphasis">could</span> get stuck on those, or go off on an ever-growing list of tangents about what‚Äôs wrong with the our practice, the wider industry, or the world as is. There‚Äôs quite a few things to latch onto, and be - extremely righteously - distracted by.
    Turns out peeps like you and us tend to be good at that sorta thing.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    That said, when it comes to us dotting the i‚Äôs on this thing, the explanation is likely a bit simpler. More honest too.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    It‚Äôd be the lack of a deadline.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h1>
    Life, work, work, life
  </h1>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Surprisingly (to us at least), it turns out it‚Äôs not strictly the effort that‚Äôs a hindrance. Next in line would be the responsibility that follows.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Having it spoken out loud will give these words a little heartbeat. Slow and steady. And a hungry stomach. That‚Äôll keep crying to be fed. They‚Äôll make us feel love, guilt, and try and claim their space.
    <br>
    And if we dare abandon them, they‚Äôll haunt us.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    But if, just <span class="emphasis">if</span>, this thing works, it‚Äôd be the most satisfying thing we‚Äôve ever done.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    What‚Äôs left for introductions? It‚Äôs time.
    <br>
    We‚Äôre about to give birth.
    <br>
    To an idea.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h1>
    Revelations
  </h1>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Before we get into all that we have to start at the proper place. That would be at the end.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    It‚Äôs the place where we typically conclude things. Come to some grand understanding. Or major reveal.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    So let‚Äôs do that first. Much more fun.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    A revelation. And one we realised we knew all along;
    <br>
    <span class="emphasis">Creativity stems from a single principle.</span>
    <br>
    <span class="emphasis">And that principle is</span> truth.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Isn‚Äôt it beautiful? The world of high-brow branding, the world of flashy advertising, of larger-than-life directors, the world that basks in self-indulgent self-expression, that world? That world is about truth.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Yes. It <span class="emphasis">truly</span> is.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Perhaps not truth as in investigative journalism truth. But truth nonetheless.
    <br>
    Let us try and show you.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    The concept hinges on the utterly mindblowing phenomena of how a particular piece of work - a clever brand expression, a soul-touching commercial, a particularly good bit of copy - can get closer to what a thing is, than anything else in the world. Including, and this is the truly mindblowing bit, closer than the thing itself.
    <br>
    It‚Äôs practically magic.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Try and picture in your mind that piece of work you love so very much.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    What I‚Äôm telling you is the reason that particular work works,
    <br>
    <span class="emphasis">is because it managed to capture truth.</span>
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Its creatives pierced the - typically well trodden - surface and dug deep. So deep there was no further to go. And there they found it. The truthy truth.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    And it‚Äôs this bit of truth that creativity uses. It feeds on it. Ideas bubble. Sparks fly. We get to soar.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    You‚Äôre probably thinking, how does that differ from us shaping expectations? From us playing with words? From us twisting what is?
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    It differs because it doesn‚Äôt ignore the truth. Not because we don‚Äôt want to. It‚Äôs because we can‚Äôt.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    When stumbling on a particular truth we don‚Äôt have to like it. It‚Äôs not our place to twist and turn. It‚Äôs to take what it is there and work with it.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    And if the truth we find doesn‚Äôt fit, change the idea. Don‚Äôt ignore the truthy truth we worked so hard for. Our souls will know if we do. Everyone‚Äôs will.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    It‚Äôs this principle why agencies can charge their clients. And why clients love the work they do.
    <br>
    Sometimes it takes the world‚Äôs most elaborate performance just to tell people <span class="emphasis">who they are</span>. Deep inside. In all its truthiness.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h1>
    The hard sell
  </h1>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    The above has always been a hard sell. This is because it requires belief and a not insignificant amount of strength to bear one‚Äôs soul. A healthy dose of chutzpah.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Which goes on to explain why it‚Äôs an easier act to follow for clients who are <span class="emphasis">in control</span>. Some might be founders, some might be motivated successors, but it‚Äôs key that the people you work with have sway over their business/project/art/whateveritis. And have given it a part of their soul.
    <br>
    No hangers-on please.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Always keep in mind, every great brand wouldn‚Äôt be where they are without having taken this plunge into their own quishy inner bits. 
    <br>
    A perfect tagline doesn‚Äôt write itself. Truth reveals.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h1>
    We live in a designer world
  </h1>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    This brings us to the rise of ‚Äúdesign‚Äù. And how creativity differs from it.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Design as a concept has worn many coats. Its shiny modern one implies a set of tools that focusses on the end user.
    <br>
    This perspective is by definition outside-in, with the person experiencing the outcome, becoming the driving force. Hence the rise in methodologies such as service- and co-design, and the underlying product-thinking that fuels it.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    This user-driven aproach focusses on understanding the user‚Äôs plight, their wishes, their problems. And through resolving these, strives to create a better world.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Creativity doesn‚Äôt do this.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Instead creativity works inside out. It‚Äôs about truthfinding and revelation. About why the why is more important than the how.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    It asks the big questions. Not to get the big answers, but to understand what it is that needs to be done.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    It‚Äôs not about seeing the world, a project, a user flow, as a set of problems. Not as a set of obstacles that need smoothing over.
    <br>
    It understands that even by taking away all friction you‚Äôre still likely to miss the point of it all. You miss the <span class="emphasis">reason</span> why people are motivated. And what they‚Äôre yearning for.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Cliche as it is, this is often not what people can tell you. It‚Äôs not user survey driven. It is what motivates us when we come face to face with something. And the thing responding back in a way that matches, satisfies, hopefully exceeds our hopes and dreams.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    And to do this we rely on truth. Because we instinctively believe it when we see it. It <span class="emphasis">just</span> feels right.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Back to design. Which clearly stole creativity‚Äôs lunch.
    <br>
    Not because it solves the same ‚Äúproblem‚Äù better. But because it‚Äôs, quite simply, being sold better.
    <br>
    How ironic.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    The story of how ux and co-design are enticing isn‚Äôt hard to follow. They provide a safe, no-one-can-be-blamed, approach to problem solving. They work because they understand the power of a <span class="emphasis">safe-sell</span>. And by excelling they managed to suck the oxygen out of the room for anything else.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Which is troublesome.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h1>
    Creativity Inc
  </h1>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    We‚Äôre not here to sell you on the value prop of creativity.
    <br>
    That‚Äôs your job.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    That said, there‚Äôs been an awful lot of amazing work that blossomed out of the creative field. We‚Äôre unironically serious about the ideas and work delivered by agencies, prod shops, and individual artists. Creativity is an art form that is essential to pushing not just the practice forwards, but that‚Äôs capable of expanding the breath of human communication. Nay, of the human experience.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    We all strive to make experiences that can excite, that concern, that make you wonder, laugh, and cry. That make a voice heard. A point of view shown. That capture our senses and have the power to change the way we think.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    That is powerful.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    And it‚Äôs precious. Sometimes vulnerable. It deserves advocacy.
    <br>
    It deserves <span class="emphasis">better</span>.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    That‚Äôs where we come in. The dream is that Wayfolk can be that haven. A shared space. A place where we de-silo. Where we learn from the world and each other. Where we share smarts and ways of working. Where some deep thinking is done that doesn‚Äôt die when a gig is over, when an individual departs or an agency closes its doors.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    The aim is to do the hard parts. Once.
    <br>
    Especially those parts that don‚Äôt fit within the day to day scope. The parts that never get made even though they‚Äôre obviously wonferful.
    <br>
    Those we will build. And distribute.
    <br>
    Because creativity deserves better. Better ideas. Better executions. Better work.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    The how and what is what we‚Äôre working on at the moment. Which, unlike delivering on a client‚Äôs brief, will take some serious time. But we can sense it. Almost taste it. And it‚Äôs going to be <span class="emphasis">fantastic</span>.
  </p>

    Promises

  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    We‚Äôll likely regret pointing out specifics at this stage, but the first bit of ‚Äúwork‚Äù we‚Äôre focusing on is your ability to deliver truly shared experiences. Like, realtime - everyone watching the moon landing live - kinda experiences.
    <br>
    Or at least the building blocks to pitch and deliver work that does so.
    <br>
    Batteries included.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Sounds vague? Maybe. But we‚Äôre building it either way. We‚Äôd recommend you stay in touching distance.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Pinky promise we‚Äôll keep you posted.
