  <h1>
    Hello creative peeps
  </h1>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    We‚Äôve started this little manifesto a couple times. And, 'til now, haven't quite managed to let it loose into that wide blue yonderful world of ours.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Excuses aplenty. For example, we <span class="emphasis">could</span> waste our time talking about how the business of creativity is a cynical one (which it is), where a fair few of our heroes fell prey to the gods of selling out (they did).
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Or we <span class="emphasis">could</span> moan about why it is that we have to bend the knee to every <span class="emphasis">silicon-valley-driven get-rich-quick-scheme</span>, that‚Äôs, bit by rotten bit, eroding our very souls.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    We <span class="emphasis">could</span> get stuck on those, or go off on an ever-growing list of grievances on what‚Äôs wrong with our practice, the wider industry, or the world as is.
    <br>You can probably tell there's a few things to latch on to, and be - extremely righteously - consumed by.
    <br>
    Turns out peeps like you and we tend to be good at that sorta thing.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    That said, when it comes to dotting the i‚Äôs on this piece of writing, the explanation is likely a bit simpler. More honest too.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    It‚Äôd be the lack of a deadline.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>
    Life, work, work, life
  </h2>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Surprisingly (to us at least), it turns out it‚Äôs not strictly the effort that‚Äôs a hindrance to finishing something. Next in line would be the responsibility that follows.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    What <span class="emphasis">is</span> clear is having them spoken out loud will give these words a little heartbeat. Slow and steady.
    <br>
    And a hungry stomach.
    One that'll keep crying to be fed.
    <br>
    It'll become its own little creature that'll make us feel love, feel guilt, and if we dare abandon it, a proper haunting.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    But if, just <span class="emphasis">if</span>, this thing works, it‚Äôd be the most satisfying thing we‚Äôve ever brought into this world.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    What‚Äôs left for introductions? It‚Äôs time.
    <br>
    We‚Äôre about to give birth.
    <br>
    To an idea.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>
    Revelations
  </h2>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    We <span class="emphasis">do</span> have to start at the proper place.
    <br>
    Which, naturally, is at the end.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    At the place where we typically conclude things. Come to some grand understanding. Or major reveal.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    So let‚Äôs do that first.
    <br>
    Much more fun.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Firstly, a Revelation. And one we realised we knew all along;
    <br>
    <br>
    <span class="emphasis">Creativity stems from a single principle.</span>
    <br>
    <span class="emphasis">And that principle is, capital T,</span>
    <br>
    Truth.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Isn‚Äôt it beautiful? The world of high-brow branding, the world of flashy advertising, of larger-than-life directors, the one that basks in self-indulgent self-expression. You know, that world? That world is all about Truth.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Yes. It <span class="emphasis">truly</span> is.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Perhaps not truth as in investigative-journalism-truth. But truth nonetheless.
    <br>
    <br>
    Let us show you.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Principally it hinges on the preposterous phenomena of how a particular piece of work ‚Äî a clever brand expression, a soul-touching commercial, a particularly good bit of copy ‚Äî can get <span class="emphasis">closer</span> to what a thing <span class="emphasis">is</span>, than anything else in the world. Including ‚Äî and this is the truly mindblowing bit ‚Äî closer than the thing itself.
    <br>
    <br>
    It‚Äôs practically magic.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Explanatory times;
    <br>
    Start by picturing that piece of work you love so very much.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    What we're telling you is the reason that particular work works,
    <br>
    is because it managed to capture <span class="emphasis">truth.</span>
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Its creatives pierced the ‚Äî typically well trodden ‚Äî surface and dug deep. So deep there was no further to go. And there they found it. For all to see.
    <br>
    The truthy truth.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    And it‚Äôs this bit of truth that creativity uses. It feeds on it. Ideas bubble. Sparks fly.
    <br>
    We get to soar.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    You‚Äôre probably thinking, how does that differ from us shaping expectations? From us playing with words? From us twisting what is?
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    We're here to tell you it differs, precisely <span class="emphasis">because</span> creativity doesn‚Äôt ignore the truth. Not because it doesn't want to. It‚Äôs because it can't.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    When stumbling on a particular truth we don‚Äôt have to like it. And yet, it‚Äôs not our place to twist and turn. It‚Äôs to take what is and work with it.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    And if the truth we find doesn‚Äôt fit, we change the idea. We don‚Äôt ignore the truthy truth we worked so hard for.
    <br>
    Our souls will know if we do. Everyone‚Äôs will.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    It‚Äôs this principle why agencies can ultimately charge their clients. And why clients love the work they do.
    <br>
    Sometimes it takes the world‚Äôs most elaborate performance just to tell people <span class="emphasis">who they are</span>. Mirror them their own truth.
    <br>
    <br>
    Deep inside, we all need some Revelation.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>
    The hard sell
  </h2>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    The above has always been a tough bill of work. This is because it requires belief and a, not insignificant, amount of strength to bare one‚Äôs soul.
    <br>
    It needs that healthy dose of chutzpah.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Which goes on to explain why it‚Äôs an easier act to follow for clients who are <span class="emphasis">in control</span>. Some might be founders, some might be motivated successors, but it‚Äôs key that the people you work with have sway over their business/project/art/whateveritis. And have given it a part of their soul.
    <br>
    Hangers-on just won't do.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Keep in mind, <span class="emphasis">[insert great brand here]</span> wouldn‚Äôt be where they are without having taken this investigatory plunge at least occasionally.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>
    We live in a designer's world
  </h2>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    This brings us to the landscape of today. The recent resurrection of ‚Äúdesign‚Äù. And how creativity differs from it.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Design as a concept has worn many coats. Its shiny modern one implies a set of tools that focuses on the end user.
    <br>
    This perspective is by definition outside-in, with the person experiencing the outcome, becoming the driving force. Hence the rise in methodologies such as service- & co-design, and the underlying product-based-thinking that fuels it.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    This user-driven approach focuses on understanding the user‚Äôs plight, their wishes, their problems. And through resolving these, strives to create a better world.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    <span class="emphasis">Creativity doesn‚Äôt do this.</span>
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Instead creativity works inside out. It‚Äôs about truthfinding and revelation. About why the why is more important than the how.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    It asks the big questions. Not to get the big answers, but to understand what it is that needs doing. To understand what's <span class="emphasis">possible</span>.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    It‚Äôs not about seeing the world as a set of problems, a set of obstacles that need smoothing over.
    <br>
    It understands that even by taking away all friction you‚Äôre still likely to miss the point of it all. You miss the <span class="emphasis">reason</span> why people are motivated. And what they‚Äôre yearning for.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Clich√© as it is, this is often not what people can tell you. It can't be found through user survey or subject matter expertise. It's what motivates us when we come face to face with something. And it responding in a way that matches, satisfies, hopefully exceeds our hopes and dreams.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    And to unearth all that, we rely on finding truth. Because, unlike outside-in practices, we instinctively believe truth it when we see it. It'll stare us in the face and we will know.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Back to design. Which clearly stole creativity‚Äôs lunch.
    <br>
    Not because it solves the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù better. But because it is, quite simply, being sold better.
    <br>
    <br>
    How ironic.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    The story of how ux and co-design are enticing isn‚Äôt hard to follow. They provide a safe, no-one-can-be-blamed, approach to problem solving. They work because they understand the power of a <span class="emphasis">safe-sell</span>. And by excelling they managed to suck the oxygen out of the room for anything else.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Which, in our opinion, is troublesome.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>
    Creativity Inc
  </h2>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    We‚Äôre not here to sell you on the value prop of creativity.
    <br>
    That‚Äôs your job.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    What we are, is unironically serious about the ideas and work delivered by agencies, production companies, and individual artists. Creativity is an art form that is essential to pushing not just the practice forwards, but that‚Äôs capable of expanding the breath of human communication. Dare we say, of the human experience.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    We all strive to make experiences that can excite, that concern, that make you wonder, laugh, or cry.
    <br>
    That make a voice heard. A point of view shown. That capture our senses and have the power to change the way we think.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    That is powerful.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    And it‚Äôs precious. Sometimes vulnerable.
    <br>
    It deserves advocacy.
    <br>
    It deserves <span class="emphasis">better</span>.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    That‚Äôs why we aspire to become a place of note. The dream is that this little not-for-profit can be a haven. A shared space. A place where we de-silo. Where we learn from the world and each other. Where we share smarts and ways of working. Where some deep thinking is done that doesn‚Äôt die when a gig is over, when an individual departs, or when an agency closes its doors.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Perhaps we'll end up as an institutional powerhouse. Ariststry-in-residence-included. Perhaps we'll run educational programs and host galleries full of mindblowing creative works.
    <br>
    But in the here and now we're focusing on hands-on stuff. Things that immediately impact your powers of creative expression. Which, ironically, makes it smell like product-work.
    <br>
    <br>
    Aw-shucks. Here we go.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    The aim is start with "the hard bits". Conceptualise these and realise their outcomes.
    <br>
    <span class="emphasis">Once.</span>
    <br>
    Especially those that don‚Äôt fit within the day to day madhouse that is the creative world.
    <br>
    <br>
    We're talking about those bits that never get made even though they‚Äôre obviously wonderful.
    <br>
    Those we <span class="emphasis">will</span> build. And distribute.
    <br>
    To all.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    The how and what is what we‚Äôre working on at the moment. Which, unlike delivering on a client‚Äôs brief, will take some time.
    <br>
    That said, we can sense it getting there. We can almost taste it. And it‚Äôs going to be <span class="emphasis">fantastic</span>.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>
    Promises
  </h2>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    We‚Äôll likely regret pointing out specifics at this stage, but the first bit of ‚Äúwork‚Äù we‚Äôre focusing on is your ability to <span class="emphasis">truly</span> deliver shared experiences.
    <br>
    <span class="emphasis">Like ‚Äî the world watching the moon landing ‚Äî kinda experiences.</span>
    <br>
    Or at least the building blocks to pitch and deliver work that does.
    <br>
    Batteries included.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Sounds vague? Maybe. But we‚Äôre building it either way. We‚Äôd recommend you stay in touching distance.
  </p>
  <br>
