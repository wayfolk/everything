  <h1>
    Hello creative peeps
  </h1>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    I’ve started this little manifesto quite a few times. And, until now, I couldn’t finish it.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- <h2>
    Why not?
  </h2> -->
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    While it’s awfully tempting to drabble some clever wordplay and rattle off a litany of excuses. For example, we <span class="emphasis">could</span> talk about how the practice of design and creativity is a cynical one (it is), where all heroes fall prey to the gods of selling out (they do).
  </p>
  <p>
    Or we <span class="emphasis">could</span> moan about why it is that we have to bend the knee to every silicon-valley driven get-rich-quick scam (we do), that’s eroding the soul of the creative space (they are).
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    We <span class="emphasis">could</span> get stuck on those, or any another clever tangent on what’s wrong with the world. There’s endless ones. People like you and me tend to be good at finding them.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    But. It’s likely a simpler explanation does the trick just as well. Probably more honest too.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    And that’d be the lack of a deadline.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>
    Haha. We in a rush now?
  </h2>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Yes. Kinda. I’m looking for the next proper gig as I’m putting these words to pixels. And I’d like to get them out before that consumes me.
    <br>
    Having it spoken out gives it a little heartbeat. Slow and steady. And a hungry stomach. That’ll cry out to be fed. It’ll make us feel love and guilt, whatever it needs to do survive.
    <br>
    In short, it means we have given birth.
    <br>
    To an idea.

  <h1>
    Let’s start with conclusions
  </h1>
  <p>
    Before we get into all that we have to start at the proper place. At the end.
  </p>
  <p>
    And in the end we typically conclude things. Come to some grand understanding. Or major reveal.
    <br>
    So let’s do that first. Much more fun.
  </p>
  <p>
    First revelation. And one I realised I knew all along (how very zen);
  </p>
  <p>
    Creativity centers around a single thing.
    <br>
    And that thing is truth.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Wait? That’s it?
  </h2>
  <p>
    Haha, isn’t it beautiful? The world of high-brow branding, the world of flashy advertising, of larger-than-life directors, the one that lives off of a fethisisation of self-expression.
    <br>
    <span class="emphasis">That</span> world is about truth?
  </p>
  <p>
    Yes. It really is.
  </p>
  <p>
    Perhaps not truth as in investigative journalism truth.
    <br>
    But truth nonetheless. Here, let me show you.
  </p>
  <p>
    You know how a particular piece of work - a clever brand expression, a soul-touching commercial, a particularly good bit of copy - can <span class="emphasis">get closer</span> to what the thing <span class="emphasis">is</span>, than anything else in the world? Sometimes even more so than the actual thing itself?
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Go on, picture in your mind that piece of work you love so much.
  </p>
  <p>
     What I’m telling you is the reason why that particular work, works so well, is because it managed to capture truth. The truth of whatever it’s about. It’s creators drilled down the tough, well trodden, surface and dug deep. So deep there was no further to go. And there it lie. The  truthy truth.
  </p>
  <p>
    And it’s this bit of truth that creativity uses. It feeds on it. Ideas bubble up. Sparks fly. We get to soar.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Isn’t that just shaping perceptions?
  </h2>
  <p>
    No. You don’t have to like a particular truth, but we humans are incredibly receptive to it.
    <br>
    And if the truth you found doesn’t fit; change the idea. Don’t ignore it. Our souls know. Everyone’s do.
    <br>
    <br>
    It’s why agencies can charge their clients. Often just to tell them who they are.
    <br>
    We all want to know who we are. Deep down.

  <h2>
    <b>What went wrong?</b>
  </h2>
  <p>
    What went wrong is that we lost. Badly.
    <br>
    <br>
    To whom you ask?
    <br>
    To answer that question it’s fundamental to understand how creativity differs from the approach of what’s often called "design".
    <br>
    Design in its modern context implies a set of tools that focusses on the end user. This focus tends to be outside-in, with the person experiencing it becoming the driving force. Hence the rise in methodologies such as co-design. 
    <br>
    It’s a type of focus that’s about understanding their plight, their wishes, their problems. And through resolving these, creating a better world.
    <br>
    <br>
    Creativity doesn’t do this.
  </p>
  <p>
   Instead, creativity works inside-out. It projects to end user. And gives them what they want but can’t ask for. By finding truth it opens the floodgates for ideas, expressions, features, you name it. That all feel right. That fit in. That make it better. Rather than reactive.
   <br>
   Just like service design, or ux, or ..., Creativity is a way of working that informs what to do. . But where it differs is that   


   ate our lunch. Simply better sold. Ironically.

  <h2>
    <b>What do we do next?</b>
  </h2>
  <p>
    Let’s build on creativity’s strenghts. We tend to see it as a top-sport. With pitches, winners and losers. Very exciting. Where we lose out is in the sharing. The caring for each other. We re-invent the fucking wheel every time.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m not advocting for a methdology, or selling another series of books on being creative.
    It’s as cliche as it gets. About the work, stupid.
    <br>
    Better work wins. We know this. It’s time to advocate and enable. We need to be able to make the case why to use the creative approach. Be humble and show. Get people excited about your ideas. And find funding together.

    Right! 
    It has one purpose. And that is to have the creativy industry make better work.
     It’s not a studio, it doesn’t employ or hire people. But it builds things. Thing to build upon. It

  <!-- <p>
    Creativity also hasn’t done itself many favours by folding for every scam. It’s hard to find a place that hasn’t become a "web3 believer" or is trying to keep the lights on by building the next crypto and/or ai brand. And I get it. It’s tough out there. A -->
