    <b>Hello fellow humans</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    I've started this little manifesto quite a few times. And, until now, I didn't finish it once. Why? Because it's hard to be above the cynical. The feelings of resentment, a cry against the stupidity in the world. Against a reality where the quick scheme wins out so often. We're in the world of, what is it now, 2023, and we've got the zeitgeist running from blockchain and web3 straight into welcoming arms of artificial intelligence and whatever investment boom is next.
