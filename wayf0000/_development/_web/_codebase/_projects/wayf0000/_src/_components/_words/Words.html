  <h1>
    Hello creative peeps
  </h1>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    We’ve started this little manifesto a couple times. And hadn't quite managed to drop it into the world proper.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Excuses aplenty. For example, we <span class="emphasis">could</span> waste our time talking about how the business of creativity is a cynical one (which it is), where a fair few of our heroes fell prey to the gods of selling out (they did).
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Or we <span class="emphasis">could</span> moan about why it is that we have to bend the knee to every <span class="emphasis">silicon-valley-driven get-rich-quick-scheme</span> out there (somehow we seem to), that’s slowly, but surely, eroding our soul (aargh).
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    We <span class="emphasis">could</span> get stuck on those, or go off on an ever-growing list of tangents about what’s wrong with our practice, the wider industry, or the world as is. As you can tell, there's a few things to latch on to, and be - extremely righteously - consumed by.
    Turns out peeps like you and us tend to be good at that sorta thing.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    That said, when it comes to us dotting the i’s on this thing, the explanation is likely a bit simpler. More honest too.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    It’d simply be the lack of a deadline.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>
    Life, work, work, life
  </h2>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Surprisingly (to us at least), it turns out it’s not strictly the effort that’s a hindrance. Next in line would be the responsibility that follows.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Having them spoken out loud will give these words a little heartbeat. Slow and steady. And a hungry stomach.
    One that'll keep crying to be fed.
    <br>
    It's a little creature that'll make us feel love, guilt, and if we dare abandon them, a proper haunting.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    But if, just <span class="emphasis">if</span>, this thing works, it’d be the most satisfying thing we’ve brought into this world.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    What’s left for introductions? It’s time.
    <br>
    We’re about to give birth.
    <br>
    To an idea.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>
    Revelations
  </h2>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Before we get into all that we have to start at the proper place. Which would, naturally, be at the end.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    It’s the place where we typically conclude things. Come to some grand understanding. Or major reveal.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    So let’s do that first. Much more fun.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Firstly, a Revelation. And one we realised we knew all along;
    <br>
    <br>
    <span class="emphasis">Creativity stems from a single principle.</span>
    <br>
    <span class="emphasis">And that principle is Truth</span>.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Isn’t it beautiful? The world of high-brow branding, the world of flashy advertising, of larger-than-life directors, the world that basks in self-indulgent self-expression. You know, that world? That world is about truth.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Yes. It <span class="emphasis">truly</span> is.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Perhaps not truth as in investigative-journalism-truth. But truth nonetheless.
    <br>
    Let us show you.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    The concept hinges on the preposterous phenomena of how a particular piece of work — a clever brand expression, a soul-touching commercial, a particularly good bit of copy — can get closer to what a thing is, than anything else in the world. Including — and this is the truly mindblowing bit — sometimes closer than the thing can itself.
    <br>
    It’s practically magic.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Explanatory times. Try and picture in your mind that piece of work you love so very much.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    What we're telling you is the reason that particular work works,
    <br>
    is because it managed to <span class="emphasis">capture truth.</span>
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Its creatives pierced the — typically well trodden — surface and dug deep. So deep there was no further to go. And there they found it. For all to see. The truthy truth.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    And it’s this bit of truth that creativity uses. It feeds on it. Ideas bubble. Sparks fly.
    <br>
    We get to soar.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    You’re probably thinking, how does that differ from us shaping expectations? From us playing with words? From us twisting what is?
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    We're here to tell you it differs, precisely <span class="emphasis">because</span> creativity doesn’t ignore the truth. Not because it doesn't want to. It’s because it can't be without.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    When stumbling on a particular truth we don’t have to like it. In those cases it’s not our place to twist and turn. It’s to take what it is and work with it.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    And if the truth we find doesn’t fit, we change the idea. Don’t ignore the truthy truth we worked so hard for. Our souls will know if we do. Everyone’s will.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    It’s this principle why agencies can ultimately charge their clients. And why clients love the work they do.
    <br>
    Sometimes it takes the world’s most elaborate performance just to tell people <span class="emphasis">who they are</span>.
    <br>
    Deep inside. We all need Truth and Revelation.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>
    The hard sell
  </h2>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    The above has always been a hard sell. This is because it requires belief and a not insignificant amount of strength to bear one’s soul. A healthy dose of chutzpah.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Which goes on to explain why it’s an easier act to follow for clients who are <span class="emphasis">in control</span>. Some might be founders, some might be motivated successors, but it’s key that the people you work with have sway over their business/project/art/whateveritis. And have given it a part of their soul.
    <br>
    Hangers-on won't do.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Keep in mind, <insert great brand> wouldn’t be where they are without having taken this investigatory plunge into their own squishy inner bits.
  </p>
  <br>

  <h2>
    We live in a designer world
  </h2>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    This brings us to the landscape of today. The recent resurrection of “design”. And how creativity differs from it.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Design as a concept has worn many coats. Its shiny modern one implies a set of tools that focuses on the end user.
    <br>
    This perspective is by definition outside-in, with the person experiencing the outcome, becoming the driving force. Hence the rise in methodologies such as service- & co-design, and the underlying product-based-thinking that fuels it.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    This user-driven approach focuses on understanding the user’s plight, their wishes, their problems. And through resolving these, strives to create a better world.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    <span class="emphasis">Creativity doesn’t do this.</span>
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Instead creativity works inside out. It’s about truthfinding and revelation. About why the why is more important than the how.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    It asks the big questions. Not to get the big answers, but to understand what it is that needs doing. To understand what's <span class="emphasis">possible</span>.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    It’s not about seeing the world as a set of problems, a set of obstacles that need smoothing over.
    <br>
    It understands that even by taking away all friction you’re still likely to miss the point of it all. You miss the <span class="emphasis">reason</span> why people are motivated. And what they’re yearning for.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Cliché as it is, this is often not what people can tell you. It can't be found though user survey or subjtect matter expertise. It is what motivates us when we come face to face with something. And the thing responding back in a way that matches, satisfies, hopefully exceeds our hopes and dreams.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    And to unearth this, we rely on finding truth. Because, unlike investigatory outside-in practices, we instinctively believe truth it when we see it. It'll stare us in the face and will quite simply <span class="emphasis">feel right.</span>
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Back to design. Which clearly stole creativity’s lunch.
    <br>
    Not because it solves the same “problem” better. But because it is, quite simply, being sold better.
    <br>
    How ironic.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    The story of how ux and co-design are enticing isn’t hard to follow. They provide a safe, no-one-can-be-blamed, approach to problem solving. They work because they understand the power of a <span class="emphasis">safe-sell</span>. And by excelling they managed to suck the oxygen out of the room for anything else.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Which, in our opinion, is troublesome.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>
    Creativity Inc
  </h2>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    We’re not here to sell you on the value prop of creativity.
    <br>
    That’s your job.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    What we are, is unironically serious about the ideas and work delivered by agencies, production companies, and individual artists. Creativity is an art form that is essential to pushing not just the practice forwards, but that’s capable of expanding the breath of human communication. Dare we say, of the human experience.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    We all strive to make experiences that can excite, that concern, that make you wonder, laugh, or cry.
    <br>
    That make a voice heard. A point of view shown. That capture our senses and have the power to change the way we think.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    That is powerful.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    And it’s precious. Sometimes vulnerable.
    <br>
    It deserves advocacy.
    <br>
    It deserves <span class="emphasis">better</span>.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    That’s where we aspire to come in. The dream is that this little not-for-profit can be a haven. A shared space. A place where we de-silo. Where we learn from the world and each other. Where we share smarts and ways of working. Where some deep thinking is done that doesn’t die when a gig is over, when an individual departs, or when an agency closes its doors.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    The aim is to do the hard parts.
    <br>
    <span class="emphasis">Once.</span>
    <br>
    Especially those that don’t fit within the day to day madhouse.
    <br>
    We're talking about those bits that never get made even though they’re obviously wonderful.
    <br>
    Those we <span class="emphasis">will</span> build. And distribute. To all.
    <br>
    Because creativity deserves better.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    The how and what is what we’re working on at the moment. Which, unlike delivering on a client’s brief, will take some time. But we can sense it getting there. Almost taste it. And it’s going to be <span class="emphasis">fantastic</span>.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>
    Promises
  </h2>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    We’ll likely regret pointing out specifics at this stage, but the first bit of “work” we’re focusing on is your ability to <span class="emphasis">truly</span> deliver shared experiences.
    <br>
    <span class="emphasis">Like, realtime — everyone watching the moon landing live — kinda experiences.</span>
    <br>
    Or at least the building blocks to pitch and deliver work that does.
    <br>
    Batteries included.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Sounds vague? Maybe. But we’re building it either way. We’d recommend you stay in touching distance.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
    Pinky promise we’ll keep you posted.
